# Hang_Man_Game_Python_Project08_beginnerLvl
This Python program selects a random word from a list, allows the player to guess letters, and displays the word with underscores for unguessed letters. The player has six attempts to guess the word, and the game ends when they either guess the word or run out of attempts.
